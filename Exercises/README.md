# Statistical Inference Exercises

This directory contains practice exercises for the Statistical Inference study material.

## Structure

Exercise files will be organized as:
- **chapter_01_exercises.ipynb**: Chapter 1 exercise problems
- **chapter_01_solutions.ipynb**: Chapter 1 solutions with explanations
- **chapter_02_exercises.ipynb**: Chapter 2 exercise problems
- **chapter_02_solutions.ipynb**: Chapter 2 solutions with explanations
- etc.

## Available Chapters for Exercises

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction - Fundamental concepts, populations, samples, distributions
- **Chapter 2**: Properties of Estimators - Bias, variance, efficiency, consistency, sufficiency
- **Chapter 8**: Nonparametric and Robust Inference - Non-parametric tests, robustness, bootstrap
- **Chapter 9**: Computationally Intensive Methods - Monte Carlo, permutation tests, MCMC
- **Chapter 10**: Generalized Linear Models - Logistic regression, Poisson regression, link functions

## Exercise Design Principles

1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Exercises range from basic concept verification to challenging applications
2. **Computational Focus**: Emphasis on implementing methods in Python, not just theory
3. **Real Data When Possible**: Use realistic scenarios and data examples
4. **Conceptual Questions**: Include questions that test understanding, not just computation
5. **Connection to Cognitive Takeaways**: Exercises reinforce the frameworks from cognitive_takeaways.md

## How to Use

1. Work through chapter_XX_exercises.ipynb without looking at solutions
2. Check your understanding against chapter_XX_solutions.ipynb
3. Review cognitive_takeaways.md in the corresponding chapter folder for conceptual frameworks
4. Experiment with variations and extensions of the exercises

## Exercise Naming Convention

Within each notebook, exercises follow this format:
- **Exercise 1.1**: First exercise for Chapter 1, section 1
- **Exercise 1.2**: Second exercise for Chapter 1, section 2
- etc.

Exercise numbers align with the section numbers in the main chapter notebooks where possible.
