# Statistical Inference Exercises

This directory contains practice exercises for each chapter of the Statistical Inference study material.

## Structure

Each chapter has its own subdirectory containing:
- **exercises.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with exercise problems
- **solutions.ipynb**: Complete solutions with explanations
- **exercises.md**: Markdown version of exercises (optional, for easy reference)

## Available Chapters

- **Chapter_01_Introduction**: Fundamental concepts, populations, samples, distributions
- **Chapter_02_Properties_of_Estimators**: Bias, variance, efficiency, consistency, sufficiency
- **Chapter_08_Nonparametric_Robust_Inference**: Non-parametric tests, robustness, bootstrap
- **Chapter_09_Computationally_Intensive_Methods**: Monte Carlo, permutation tests, MCMC
- **Chapter_10_Generalized_Linear_Models**: Logistic regression, Poisson regression, link functions

## Exercise Design Principles

1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Exercises range from basic concept verification to challenging applications
2. **Computational Focus**: Emphasis on implementing methods in Python, not just theory
3. **Real Data When Possible**: Use realistic scenarios and data examples
4. **Conceptual Questions**: Include questions that test understanding, not just computation
5. **Connection to Cognitive Takeaways**: Exercises reinforce the frameworks from cognitive_takeaways.md

## How to Use

1. Work through exercises.ipynb without looking at solutions
2. Check your understanding against solutions.ipynb
3. Review cognitive_takeaways.md in the corresponding chapter folder for conceptual frameworks
4. Experiment with variations and extensions of the exercises

## Exercise Naming Convention

Within each notebook, exercises follow this format:
- **Exercise 1.1**: First exercise for Chapter 1, section 1
- **Exercise 1.2**: Second exercise for Chapter 1, section 2
- etc.

Exercise numbers align with the section numbers in the main chapter notebooks where possible.
