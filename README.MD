This repo is about "paul garthwaite's book on statistical inference".

It will be an interactive tutoring session where we will go through the book chapter by chapter, and I will answer questions and help you understand the material.

I will use claude code with the code along mode to help you understand the material.

 first search for each chapter, then create each chapter as you go and make it in a way that I can practice it with Claude code code along mode
