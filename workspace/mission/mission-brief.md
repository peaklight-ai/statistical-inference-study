# Mission Brief

## Overall Objective
Create super practical wisdom document translating statistical inference concepts into actionable principles for everyday thinking and problem-solving (from daily decisions to serious challenges).

## Success Criteria
- **Actionable:** Each principle has clear "do this, not that" guidance
- **Pattern + Validation framework:** Explicitly addresses how we see patterns and how to validate them
- **Grounded in Chapter 1:** Maps directly to statistical concepts (sampling, bias, variance, CLT, inference)
- **No fluff:** Concise, precise, immediately useful
- **Broad applicability:** Works for day-to-day decisions AND complex problems

## Specialists Involved

### 1. Pattern Breaker (lateral-thinking)
**Why:** Generate practical frameworks from statistical concepts, break down "better thinking" systematically
**Delivers:** Practical wisdom document with actionable principles

### 2. Logic Validator (vertical-thinking)
**Why:** Stress-test each principle for logical soundness, eliminate platitudes
**Delivers:** Validated principles that hold up to scrutiny

## Strategic Context

**Source Material:**
- Chapter 1 notebook: populations vs samples, parameters vs statistics, bias-variance, CLT, three types of inference
- cognitive_takeaways.md: Our cognitive bugs (confuse SD/SE, poor sampling intuition, see patterns in noise)

**Key Insight to Leverage:**
Statistical thinking = systematic correction of cognitive bugs. The same framework applies to everyday reasoning:
1. We see patterns (natural human tendency)
2. We need validation (statistical rigor)
3. We confuse signal and noise
4. We underestimate uncertainty
5. We trust small "samples" (limited experiences)

**Constraints:**
- Must be practical, not academic
- Must work outside statistics (business decisions, personal choices, complex problems)
- Must be memorable and actionable

## Collaboration Pattern
**Sequential Pipeline:**
1. Pattern Breaker creates practical wisdom framework
2. Logic Validator validates logical soundness

## Expected Flow

**Pattern Breaker Output:**
- Practical principles mapped to statistical concepts
- "Pattern + Validation" framework as core structure
- Actionable guidance for daily thinking
- Examples across problem types (decisions, planning, troubleshooting, learning)

**Logic Validator Input:**
- Pattern Breaker's framework

**Logic Validator Output:**
- Validated principles (no logical flaws)
- Identification of any platitudes or weak reasoning
- Strengthened actionable guidance

**Final Deliverable:**
Update existing `Chapter_01_Introduction/cognitive_takeaways.md` with new section on practical wisdom for everyday thinking

## Key Decisions & Rationale

**Why Sequential not Parallel:**
Logic Validator needs Pattern Breaker's full framework to validate holistically

**Why these 2 specialists:**
- Pattern Breaker: Creative synthesis from statistical concepts → practical wisdom
- Logic Validator: Ensure rigor, avoid feel-good but hollow advice

**Why not Implementation/Execution specialists:**
This is conceptual synthesis, not code or deployment

## Handoff Contract

**Pattern Breaker receives:**
- This mission brief
- Reference to Chapter_01_Introduction/chapter_01_introduction.ipynb
- Reference to Chapter_01_Introduction/cognitive_takeaways.md
- Core theme: "Pattern + Validation" as fundamental thinking framework

**Logic Validator receives:**
- Pattern Breaker's output
- Instruction: Validate each principle for logical soundness, identify weak reasoning
